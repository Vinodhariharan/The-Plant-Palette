      <h1 style={{fontSize:"40px", padding:"10px"}} >Our Story:</h1>

<p style={{fontSize:'20px', padding:"20px"}}>Founded in 2012 by Vinayak Patel, The Plant Palette was born from a shared passion for greenery and a belief that bringing nature indoors wasn't just trendy, it was transformative. We started with a tiny cart at the local farmer's market, bursting with colorful succulents and sun-kissed herbs. Today, we've blossomed into a thriving haven for plant enthusiasts, curating a collection as diverse as your imagination.
